# ImageUploader
A image uploader built using PHP. Just upload it to your site and works!
If you want to use admin, please go to adminconf.php and put your secure key to login at admin.php. Currently there are three features, to delete, to suspend in time and to change author name and restrict admin.
Feel free to share this but please do not remove the credits. This is the result of my hardwork done on this resource for 1-2 months.
