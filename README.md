# ImageUploader
A advanced image uploader, which is built on PHP and Java-script. This resource uses MySQL, so you will be needing a MySQL server, later I'll make it that you can switch to SQLite (not recommended from me if you have huge number of visits. 

#MySQL Setup
To setup the mysql, first type your details in images_sqlite.php in the upload folder. After that, start your mysql and visit your page. Go to this link: your/site/uploads/images_sqlite.php and see if it tells "Connection Failed: and some error right here", if it's blank it's working completely fine and you will be able to use it good! If it gives an error just contact me on the site given below.

#Last words
Best of luck and I hope you make good use and star this!
I'm always available at this site for my image uploader:
